_*whisper your dreams*_

## Motivation

- Everyone dreams every time they sleep, whether they remember it or not
- Dreams can be fascinating, exciting, terrifying, or bizarre
- Dreams are your brain‚Äôs way of collecting and clearing out useless information from the day
- Dreams tell us some the most fascinating stories, relizations, and guidances.
- __*People forget 90% of their dreams within 10 minutes of waking up*__
